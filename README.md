# Sample-code-for-9DOF-and-TSL2561-with-Nano
Code that will collect and report data from the 9DOF and TSL2561 sensors when using an Arduino Nano
**All of the code used in this repository was created by the wonderful people at Sparkfun and Adafruit**
**I am simply combining and streamlining this code for private use**
